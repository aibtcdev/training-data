# Developer Guides

The real power of sBTC will come from developers building applications that utilize it. These guides will show you how to utilize sBTC in your applications.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Big caveat for the developer tutorials: These tutorials utilized libraries that used the previous OP\_RETURN system. sBTC is being redesigned to utilize only OP\_DROP, so these libraries will change. You can view the tutorials as a way to familiarize yourself with how you might build on sBTC, but know that this will change.
