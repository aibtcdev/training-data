<p class="p-3 rounded-lg bg-neutral-100 text-neutral-500 dark:bg-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-400">Ordhook enables you to build Ordinals event streams, so you can create accurate databases that gracefully handle Bitcoin forks and reorgs.</p>

<div class="mb-10"></div>

Ordhook is a reorg-aware indexer that automatically handles chain forks, so you don’t need to waste time or resources reindexing your database. With a familiar event-driven framework, you can customize what Ordinals data you index in order to create lightweight databases for faster query responses and a better user experience.

### Install Ordhook

Clone the [Ordhook Repo](https://github.com/hirosystems/ordhook.git):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hirosystems/ordhook.git
```

Navigate to the root directory and run `cargo ordhook-install` to install:

```sh
cd ordhook && cargo ordhook-install
```

### Create Event Streams

<div class="subSections my-8">
  <a href="/ordhook/guides/scan-ordinal-activities">
    <div class="subSectionTitle"><h3>Scan past Ordinals activity</h3><span>→</span></div>
    <p>Fetch historical ordinals activity, whether for a range of blocks or for a particular inscription.</p>
  </a>
  <a href="/ordhook/guides/stream-ordinal-activities">
    <div class="subSectionTitle"><h3>Stream Ordinals activity</h3><span>→</span></div>
    <p>Create webhook-like triggers that listen for ordinals activity and post that activity to a local server or file.</p>
  </a>
</div>

<div class="subSections my-8 lg:w-[50%]">
  <a href="/ordhook/guides/ordhook-as-a-service-bitcoind">
    <div class="subSectionTitle"><h3>Run Ordhook as a service</h3><span>→</span></div>
    <p>Spin up an ongoing service that listens for future ordinals activity and posts that data to a local server.</p>
  </a>
</div>
