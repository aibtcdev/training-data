<p class="p-3 rounded-lg bg-neutral-100 text-neutral-500 dark:bg-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-400">Clarinet is a local development environment that offers everything you need to create, test, and deploy smart contracts on Stacks.</p>

<div class="mb-10"></div>

Using a simple command line interface, Clarinet enables you to build and iterate on your contracts locally before moving into production on mainnet. You can code with Clarity syntax support (the smart contract language for Stacks), run tests, debug your code line by line, and deploy your contracts to a local Stacks blockchain environment to rapidly iterate on your code.

Clarinet can be used locally or as a hosted service in the cloud via the [Hiro Platform](https://docs.hiro.so/platform).
