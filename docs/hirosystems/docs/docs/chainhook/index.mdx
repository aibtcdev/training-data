<p class="p-3 rounded-lg bg-neutral-100 text-neutral-500 dark:bg-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-400">Chainhook enables you to build custom event streams for Bitcoin layers and trigger actions based on those events.</p>

<div class="mb-10"></div>

Chainhook is a reorg-aware indexer that serves reliable blockchain data—saving you time by avoiding reindexing your database every time there’s a fork. Chainhook also lets you index only the data you need, which means you can build lighter databases, get faster query results, and deliver a better experience to your users.

Chainhook can be used as a tool in [your local development environment](https://docs.hiro.so/chainhook/getting-started) and as [a hosted service in the cloud](https://docs.hiro.so/platform/guides/create-chainhooks) via the Hiro Platform.

### Install Chainhook

Clone the [Chainhook Repo](https://github.com/hirosystems/chainhook.git):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hirosystems/chainhook.git
```

Navigate to the root directory and run `cargo chainhook-install` to install:

```sh
cd chainhook && cargo chainhook-install
```
