<p class="p-3 rounded-lg bg-neutral-100 text-neutral-500 dark:bg-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-400">Subnets are an experimental scaling solution for Stacks that offer low latency and high throughput, enabling you to build fast, reliable experiences for your users.</p>

<div class="mb-10"></div>

Subnets are separate networks from the Stacks blockchain and can have different consensus rules and trust assumptions. Each individual subnet has its own smart contract on Stacks that enables users to bridge assets to/from it. For example, individual apps that have a high volume of transactions can choose to launch an app-specific subnet to provide a better experience for their users.

> **_NOTE:_**
>
> You can launch a subnet on Stacks mainnet today, but more work is needed to fully support subnets via Hiro tools. Reach out to us on Discord if you are interested in launching a subnet for your app.
